"Evil Angel"

Hold it together, birds of a feather,
Nothing but lies and crooked wings.
I have the answer, spreading the cancer,
You are the faith inside me.

No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't remember, remember.

[Chorus:]
Put me to sleep evil angel.
Open your wings evil angel.

A-ah.

I'm a believer,
Nothing could be worse,
All these imaginary friends.
Hiding betrayal,
Driving the nail,
Hoping to find a savior.

No, don't
Leave me to die here,
Help me survive here.
Alone, don't
Surrender, surrender.

[Chorus]

Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel?

[Chorus]

Oh.
Fly over me evil angel.
Why can't I breathe evil angel?
