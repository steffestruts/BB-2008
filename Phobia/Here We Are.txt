"Here We Are"

Sing it for me,
I can't erase the stupid things I say.
You're better than me,
I struggle just to find a better way.

[Chorus:]
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone.
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye.

You wouldn't like me.
Keep moving on until forever ends.
Don't try to fight me.
The beauty queen has lost her crown again.

[Chorus]

...goodbye.

So why are you so eager to betray?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.
So why are you the one that walks away?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up.

O-oh.

[Chorus]

Just take a breath and softly say goodbye.
