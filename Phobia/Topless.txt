"Topless"

Fruit on the vine.
You've got yours,
And I've got mine.
Meat on your bones.
They won't know, they won't know.

[Chorus:]
I love your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.

I'm on my way, to feel you,
dislocate.
Safe in your space.
I'm open, wide open.

[Chorus]

Like me, like me, like me.

[Chorus]

Me, me, me.
