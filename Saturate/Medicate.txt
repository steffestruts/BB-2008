"Medicate"

I got somethin' up my sleeve
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
I know you will cover me
I've got bruises on my knees
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

[Chorus:]
Run away
Make haste
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

I got somethin' up my sleeve
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
I know you will cover me
I've got bruises on my knees
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

[Chorus x 3]
