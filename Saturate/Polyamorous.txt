"Polyamorous"

The day has come to an end
The sun is over my head
My polyamorous friend
You got me in a mess of trouble again

[Chorus:]
So
Just when you think that you're all right
I'm crawling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

They've come to get me again
The cloud is over my head
My polyamorous friend
You got me in a mess of trouble again

[Chorus]

Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?

[Chorus]

Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Let's go
