"Shallow Bay"

come on
the sun will rise
another time
the colors blind
your virgin eyes
I'm so inclined
to make you mine
you're out of line
and out of time
[chorus]
and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me
don't over kill
this painless thrill
it's bitter still
your pretty pill
you wait until
you've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will
[chorus]
a shallow bay
a shallow bay
[chorus x 2]
you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live
