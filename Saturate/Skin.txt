"Skin"

Well I know you don't know the reason
And it's cold, a sign of the season
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'll be better, get away
Send a letter, bombs away

[Chorus:]
You're covered in my skin
I couldn't imagine anyone else
I'm off for the weekend
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself

Well it's gone and it's not returning
And your clothes and pictures are burning
'Cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I couldn't imagine
Why you would save yourself
