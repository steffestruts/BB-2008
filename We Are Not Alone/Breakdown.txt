"Breakdown"

Breakdown!

Let the fun and games begin
She is spayed and broken in
Skin is cold and white
Such a lovely lonely night

[Pre-chorus]
Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate
but I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again
and I want an end
'cause I feel you creeping in

[Chorus:]
What I found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound, you're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

Drank up all my alcohol
This is not a free for all
I'll be there for you
'Til my heart is black and blue

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
